                <p>
                    The BQ76942 Balancer is an integrated circuit specifically designed for battery management
                    applications, with a particular focus on multi-cell lithium-ion or lithium-polymer battery packs.
                    Serving as a sophisticated component of a battery management system (BMS), the BQ76942 offers
                    advanced functionalities such as monitoring cell voltages, balancing charge distribution, and
                    sensing temperature levels. Its primary objective is to ensure the safe and efficient operation of
                    battery packs by closely monitoring individual cell voltages and tem-perature, thereby preventing
                    issues like overcharging, over-discharging, and thermal runa-way. By redistributing charge among
                    cells, the balancer functionality maintains optimal cell balance, extending battery life and
                    enhancing the overall reliability of the system. With its compact size and comprehensive range of
                    features, the BQ76942 Balancer plays a crucial role in the design and implementation of
                    high-performance battery management systems across various applications, including electric
                    vehicles, renewable energy storage systems, and portable electronics.

                <h2>Voltage Measurement</h2>
                <p>`Technical Reference Manual BQ76942 @ page 19`</p>
                <p>The BQ76942 device integrates a voltage ADC that is multiplexed between measurements of cell
                    voltages, an internal temperature sensor, up to nine external thermistors, and also performs
                    measurements of the voltage at the VC10 pin, the PACK pin, the LD pin, the internal Vref used by the
                    coulomb counter, and the VSS rail (for diagnostic purposes). The BQ76942 device supports measurement
                    of individual differential cell voltages in a series configuration, ranging from 3 series cells to
                    10 series cells. Each cell
                    voltage measurement is a differential measurement of the voltage between two adjacent cell input
                    pins, such as VC1–VC0, VC2–VC1, and so forth. The cell voltage measurements are processed based on
                    trim and calibration corrections, and
                    then reported in 16-bit resolution using units of 1 mV. The raw 24-bit digital output of the ADC is
                    also
                    available for readout using 32-bit subcommands (the 24-bit data is contained in the lower 3 bytes of
                    the
                    32-bit data, and is sign-extended to create the upper byte). The cell voltage measurements can
                    support a
                    recommended voltage range from –0.2 V to 5.5 V. If a cell voltage is applied that exceeds a level of
                    5 ×
                    VREF1 (approximately 6.06 V), the device may report a value of –6.06 V (and the cell voltage raw
                    counts
                    similarly would report a value of -8388608). For best performance, stay at a maximum input of 5.5 V.
                    The
                    16-bit cell and VC10 (stack), PACK, and LD pin voltage measurements are available by using the
                    commands
                    listed below.</p>

                <h2>Direct commands and sub commands</h2>
                <p>`Technical Reference Manual BQ76942 @ page 13`</p>
                <p>The direct commands are accessed using a 7-bit command address that is sent from a host through the
                    device
                    serial communications interface and either triggers an action, provides a data value to be written
                    to the
                    device, or instructs the device to report data back to the host.</p>
                <p>Subcommands are additional commands that are accessed indirectly using the 7-bit command address
                    space and
                    provide the capability for block data transfers. When a subcommand is initiated, a 16-bit</p>
                <p>subcommand address is first written to the 7-bit command addresses 0x3E (lower byte) and 0x3F (upper
                    byte).

                    The problem stems from the need to create links between the last battery cell and the VC10 and BAT
                    terminals of the integrated circuit (IC), along with the obligation to connect the second-to-last
                    battery cell, starting from its connection point (e.g., 3S Battery VC3), to all previous cell
                    connections that lead to the BQ76942 Battery Management IC, except for the VC10 connection as this
                    Pin has to be connected to the last Cell of the Battery pack.
