                    The BQ76942 Balancer is an integrated circuit specifically designed for battery management
                    applications, with a particular focus on multi-cell lithium-ion or lithium-polymer battery packs.
                    Serving as a sophisticated component of a battery management system (BMS), the BQ76942 offers
                    advanced functionalities such as monitoring cell voltages, balancing charge distribution, and
                    sensing temperature levels. Its primary objective is to ensure the safe and efficient operation of
                    battery packs by closely monitoring individual cell voltages and tem-perature, thereby preventing
                    issues like overcharging, over-discharging, and thermal runa-way. By redistributing charge among
                    cells, the balancer functionality maintains optimal cell balance, extending battery life and
                    enhancing the overall reliability of the system. With its compact size and comprehensive range of
                    features, the BQ76942 Balancer plays a crucial role in the design and implementation of
                    high-performance battery management systems across various applications, including electric
                    vehicles, renewable energy storage systems, and portable electronics.

                    The problem stems from the need to create links between the last battery cell and the VC10 and BAT
                    terminals of the integrated circuit (IC), along with the obligation to connect the second-to-last
                    battery cell, starting from its connection point (e.g., 3S Battery VC3), to all previous cell
                    connections that lead to the BQ76942 Battery Management IC, except for the VC10 connection as this
                    Pin has to be connected to the last Cell of the Battery pack.
